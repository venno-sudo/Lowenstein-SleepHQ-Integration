# Lowenstein-SleepHQ-Integration
A project to upload the data from a Lowenstein medical device SD card to Sleep HQ web site.

This project builds upon the work by mstone672 sleephq-lowenstein-api:

https://github.com/mstone672/sleephq-lowenstein-api

This above script is the main part of the project to import the data from a Lowenstein Prisma 20a cpap device into an account at Sleep HQ using their api.

I have had to hard code the Team ID portion of this script as I had errors when executing it with the 'get_team_id' function being called.

Refer to overview file and individual txt files for further information on how to perform the integration. You may wish to leave out parts not required for your purpose. You will also have to adjust paths and variables to suite your installation.
